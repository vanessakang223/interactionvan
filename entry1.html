    <h2>What is the Difference between CSS and Html?</h2>
    <p>Html (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard coding language used to structure websites, while Css (Cascading Style Sheets) modifies the appearance of the pages. Essentially, it describes the display of html. </p>

    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>Javacript is basically the more advanced version of CSS. It is more dynamic and allows for more specifications. However, it is also more difficult than CSS for beginners. </p>
