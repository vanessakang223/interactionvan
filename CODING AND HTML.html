    <p>CODING AND HTML</p>
    <p>Here are some of the things I learned in Core 1: Interaction</p>
    <li>I learned how to organize information and make a basic list using html</li>
    <li>How to incorporate an image into my webpage</li>
    <li style="color: red;">How to change the color of text (am still working on how to change the color of one word)</li>
    <li>Introduced to the basic functions of github</li>
    <li>How to link to external pages like this:</li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a>
    <li>I was introduced to the basic types of programming language like html, CSS and Javascript</li>
    <p>HTML vs. CSS</p>
    <p>Html (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard coding language used to structure websites, while Css (Cascading Style Sheets) modifies the appearance of the pages. Essentially, it describes the display of html. </p>
    <img src="ok.png" alt="CSS" width="540" height="66">
    <br>
    <p>JAVASCRIPT</p>
    <p>Javacript is basically the more advanced version of CSS. It is more dynamic and allows for more specifications. However, it is also more difficult than CSS for beginners. </p>
